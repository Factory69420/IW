5 Operational domains:

Space: Outside atmosphere

Important:
greater than 100 kilometers above mean sea level

Land: Self explanatory





Air: everything below space above ground







Sea: Maritime navy shit



Cyberspace: thats us. Global domain within the information enviorment consisting interdependent network of info.


Layers of cyberspace:

Physical Network layer

Logical Network layer

Cyber Persona layer




IMPORTANT: Access can be gained through any combination of wired, optical or wireless means. While some accesses can be achieved remotely through assigned permissions and other means legitmate or fruadulent access to closed networks and other systems that are virtually isolated may require physical proximity or more complex, time consuming processes



LSA 2: Exaplain the Joint All-Domain Operations Concept


The integrated planning and employment of Joint and Interagency information capabilities , resources and activities that enchance the single battle concept and provide defensive, offensive and exploitative effects and support in order to operate, fight and win in and through a contested information enviroment



JADC2
The warfighting capability to sense, make snese and act at all levels and phases of war, across all domains and with partners to deliver information advantage at the speed of relevance.




The Problem:

Competetion:
In a state of continuous competition, China and Ruissia exploit the conditions of the operational environment to achieve their objectives without resorting to armed conflict by fracturing U.S. alliances, partnerships and resolve



Conflict:
In armed conflict China and Russia seek to achieve physical stand off by employing layers of anti access and area denial systems designed to rapidly inflict unacceptable losses on U.S. and parnet millitary forces achieving campaign objectives within days faster than the U.S. can effectively respond.









LSA 3: Outline the Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF) and MEF information group (MIG)





Important: The MDEB Supports MDTF targeting efforts by providing near real time signals and intelligence (SIGINT), geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) and open source (OSINT) target acquisiton and products.








Multi Domain Effects Battalion: (MDEB) provides mutli domain sensing and intelligence support, target development and delivery and synchronization of 




MEF: The Mef information group (MIG) cordinates integrates and employs cpabilities for information environment operations i order to ensure the marine air ground task fource (MAGTF) commanders ability




IMPORTANT: EABO - A form of expeditionary warfare that involves the employment of mobile, low signature, persistent and relatively easy to main and sustain naval expeditionary fores.











New Slidedeck: Introduction to join operations




Important: The united states entered World War 2 (WW2) with an archaic military organization, incapable of coordinating land, sea and air activities across its two millitary departments (War and Navy)



Important: In 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) by executive direction primarily to work with the British, Who had a combined chiefs of staf organiation.

Specific Responsibilites were not defined, and service politics and jealousies frustrated efforts to conduct efficient joint operations.





Important: During and after WW2, numerous efforts sought to rectify the US militarys disjointednesss


The national Security act of 1947:
Created the national Millitary Establishment (A DOD precursor)
Prescribed a weak SECDEF
Gave legal standing to the JCS, but no chairman
Continued to empower the Millitary Deparment Secretaries as members of both the cabinet and the new National Securit Council (NSC); service domination also continued to trump the authority of unified commanders in the field



Legislated Revisions to the national Security Act in 1949, 1953 and 1958 attempted to mend these defiencies particularly bu
Strengthing the Secdef
Establishinhg the chair of the joint cheifs of staff CJCS
Removing Millitary secretaries and serivice chiefs from opeerational chain of command
Giving unified commanders full operation command of assinged forces



Important: However these provisions were not effectively implemented, so the millitary departments retained a de faco role in the operationlal chain of command and never complied with the provision of strenghting the unified commanders.



Important: Numerous millitary failures highlighted instituional defencies at all levels. The adhoc nature of the joint effort in these operations contributed to an inability to effectively link tactical actions to strategic ends.



Goldwater-Nichols Act 1986



Important: In addition to the impetus provided by these operational failures, several disparata factors came together in the mid 190s which enabled DOD organizational change. These included extensive congressional hearings, a major senate inquir, bi-partisan openness to rectify the situiation a presidentail commission, and the appointment of a reform minded CJCS Admiral William Crowe, In October 1985.
Major Changes:
Chain of command and Millitary Advice


Interaction of the Services


Personnel Management


Shared Procurement

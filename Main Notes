5 Operational domains:

Space: Outside atmosphere

Important:
greater than 100 kilometers above mean sea level

Land: Self explanatory





Air: everything below space above ground







Sea: Maritime navy shit



Cyberspace: thats us. Global domain within the information enviorment consisting interdependent network of info.


Layers of cyberspace:

Physical Network layer

Logical Network layer

Cyber Persona layer




IMPORTANT: Access can be gained through any combination of wired, optical or wireless means. While some accesses can be achieved remotely through assigned permissions and other means legitmate or fruadulent access to closed networks and other systems that are virtually isolated may require physical proximity or more complex, time consuming processes



LSA 2: Exaplain the Joint All-Domain Operations Concept


The integrated planning and employment of Joint and Interagency information capabilities , resources and activities that enchance the single battle concept and provide defensive, offensive and exploitative effects and support in order to operate, fight and win in and through a contested information enviroment



JADC2
The warfighting capability to sense, make snese and act at all levels and phases of war, across all domains and with partners to deliver information advantage at the speed of relevance.




The Problem:

Competetion:
In a state of continuous competition, China and Ruissia exploit the conditions of the operational environment to achieve their objectives without resorting to armed conflict by fracturing U.S. alliances, partnerships and resolve



Conflict:
In armed conflict China and Russia seek to achieve physical stand off by employing layers of anti access and area denial systems designed to rapidly inflict unacceptable losses on U.S. and parnet millitary forces achieving campaign objectives within days faster than the U.S. can effectively respond.









LSA 3: Outline the Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF) and MEF information group (MIG)





Important: The MDEB Supports MDTF targeting efforts by providing near real time signals and intelligence (SIGINT), geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) and open source (OSINT) target acquisiton and products.








Multi Domain Effects Battalion: (MDEB) provides mutli domain sensing and intelligence support, target development and delivery and synchronization of 




MEF: The Mef information group (MIG) cordinates integrates and employs cpabilities for information environment operations i order to ensure the marine air ground task fource (MAGTF) commanders ability




IMPORTANT: EABO - A form of expeditionary warfare that involves the employment of mobile, low signature, persistent and relatively easy to main and sustain naval expeditionary fores.
